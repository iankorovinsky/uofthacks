## Best Use of Starknet

Starknet is redefining the very notion of Web3 by tackling one of the most intimidating technical challenges in the industry - scaling a blockchain while maintaining its security and decentralization.

Starknet was the first general purpose ZK-Rollup service on Ethereum in Feb. 2022, and has proved its potential to be a market leader. Essentially, it increases the processing speed, while reducing the cost of operating on the Ethereum blockchain.

As a result, we are seeing a variety of "traditional" tech businesses - payments / social media / AI / online gaming - now being integrated with blockchains using our technology.
