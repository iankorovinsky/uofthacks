            "context": "The image shows a group of individuals dressed in white clothing performing what appears to be a dance or some sort of synchronized movement in an outdoor setting. They are gathered under an archway structure with lights and the sign reads \"KENNY'S COVE.\" The environment looks like a pier or boardwalk by the ocean, and there is a boat visible on the right. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting good weather. The exact context of the gathering is not clear from the image, but it possibly could be a celebration, performance, or a scene from a film or music video. The photo is not very sharp, possibly indicating motion or a low-resolution source.",
